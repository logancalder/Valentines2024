This little HTML project was my fun Valentines ask for my girlfriend, Hannah, this year :)

I wanted to do something fun and original so I decided on coding my ask for her. I had seen people doing letters or flowers, so I figured why not make something in an area that I am *somewhat* proficient in?

The project features an animated beating heart, text transitions, and a few prompts asking her to be my Valentine (I know its a bit cheesy but I love it). She has the option to click yes or no, with no changing the text to beg her to say yes in another form. Of course, she is not allowed to say no, and the cycle will repeat infinitely until she says yes :D

I am quite happy with how it turned out, and tried my best to write clean and readable code for anybody else who'd like to edit and use this.
